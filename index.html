Origami comes from the Japanese words ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper." It is the art of paper folding,      
which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all    
folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat, square sheet of paper into a finished   
sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts,       
glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.    </p>
